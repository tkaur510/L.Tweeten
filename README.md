# Ethiopia's Population and Food Consumption

We will be analyzing the Ethiopia dataset and finding correlations that fit our project goals that include analyzing the proper nutrients needed for households, the demand for the goods in our dataset, and forming policy decisions for our population of interest.


1.4 Demand Estimate
Looking at the overall demand for Ethiopia for the products given and specifically looking at the demand of high energy goods in comparison to each other

1.5 and 1.6 Nutrition
The nutrition estimates are based on the iron-levels of the foods and looking into the overal nutrient intake of the households for Ethiopia

Most of the code is meant to inform policy decisions that we aim to look at which include but are not limited to increasing the iron intake for Ethiopia populations and capturing the overall energy levels of Ethiopia via taking a look at the caloric intake. 

1.9 Technological Innovation
By changing the amount of iron by increasing it to the needed iron intake of 15.5-16, we measure the comparison to the current iron intake and see if technology can be used to make a superfood that includes more iron and increases the caloric intake of the population

The CSVs are meant to ensure that the code runs smoothly when replicated.
